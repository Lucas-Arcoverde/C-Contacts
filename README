OVERVIEW
--------

Simple cli contact book programmed in C. It is project made for fun and learning, I do not recommend you to use it seriously.
The program only have basic features but works fine. AI was only used to ask questions and fix some code that didnot work.

FEATURES
--------

At this moment, CCM --- how i like to call --- only works in command line interface, but maybe i will make a TUI for it later.

It can:

* Add 100 contacts --- this can be changed in the source code, so do all the features.
* Update/Change a contact info.
* View your contact list.
* Delete a contact from your list.
